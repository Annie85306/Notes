## 238. Product of Array Except Self
üîó  Link: [Product of Array Except Self](\https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/)<br>
üí° Difficulty: Medium<br>
üõ†Ô∏è Topics: Array<br>

=======================================================================================<br>
Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]<br>
Output: [24,12,8,6]<br>

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]<br>
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]<br>

 
Constraints:
- 2 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- -30 <= nums[i] <= 30
- The input is generated such that `answer[i]` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.
 

Follow up: Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

### UMPIRE Method:
#### Understand

> - Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
> - Choose a ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs. 
> - Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.
1. Can the `nums` array be empty?<br>
   No, at least two elements in the array.<br>
2. Any requirements on time/space complexity?<br>
   You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.<br>
3. Happy path - Input: nums = [1,5,3,2]; Output: [30,6,10,15]
4. Edge case - Input: nums = [0,1]; Output: [1,0]
5. Edge case - Input: nums = [0,0]; Output: [0,0]

### Match
> - See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category
1. Prefix/suffix<br>
 <br>

### Plan
> - Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode
> - Walk through a high level implementation with an existing diagram

General Idea: Compute prefix and suffix products first, then use their products to construct the answer array

1) Compute prefix product and suffix products, each having a length of `len(nums) + 1`
2) For i=0 to i=`len(nums)`, `answer[i]` = `prefix[i]` * `suffix[n-i-1]`
    
### Implement
> - Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants)

see solution.py

### Review
> - Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples
> - Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug
### Evaluate
> - Finish by giving space and run-time complexity
> - Discuss any pros and cons of the solution

Assume N represents the number of items in the array.


- Time Complexity: O(N) for computing prefix and suffix products, and constructing the answer array.
- Space Complexity: O(N)

Follow up: Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity?

### Plan
General Idea: Sort in advance, then decide if two intervals overlap according to the latter's `starti`.

1) Sort according to the first element in every interval
2) Track current interval that is going to be compared while traversing the `intervals` list by storing it in a variable `curr`
3) Traverse the `intervals`
    - If the first element of each interval is smaller than or equal to current interval's `endi`, meaning the two intervals overlap, append a new interval to the answer
    - The `starti` of the new interval is that of the current interval, and its `endi` is the larger one of the two `endi`s
    - Else, append current interval to the answer
