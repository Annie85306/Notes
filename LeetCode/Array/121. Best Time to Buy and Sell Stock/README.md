## 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
üîó Link: [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/)<br>
üí° Difficulty: Easy<br>
üõ†Ô∏è Topics: Array<br>

=======================================================================================<br>

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> day.<br>

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.<br>

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]<br>
Output: 5<br>
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.<br>
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]<br>
Output: 0<br>
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

- 1 <= prices.length <= 105<br>
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 104<br>

### UMPIRE Method:
#### Understand

> - Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
> - Choose a ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs. 
> - Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.
1. Can the array `prices` be empty?
- No, the length of an array is restricted to be greater than or equal to 1, so there must be at least one element in the array, and the array cannot be empty.
2. In this case, is short selling or day trading possible?
- No, buying must be before selling.
3. Happy cases<br>  Input: prices = [10,2,5] ; Output: 3<br>
4. Are there any time or space complexity I should be aware of?
- An optimal solution would have O(n) in time complexity and O(1) in space complexity

### Match
> - See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category

1. Array<br>
The main task is to perform calculations or operations on the given array.

### Plan
> - Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode
> - Walk through a high level implementation with an existing diagram

General idea: Find the max and min values in the given array and their corresponding indices. Several situations can occur as follows:<br>

1) There exists different max and min values and<br>

    a) the index of the minimun is smaller than the index of the maximum: output the difference between the maximum and minimum<br>
    
    b) the index of the minimun is larger than the index of the maximum:<br>
   
    - Remove the maximum value from the array, then find the next maximum value and repeat the process until the index of the minimum is smaller than the index of the maximum.<br>
    - If fails, the process might go to step 3.<br>
    
3) The max and min values are the same and<br>

    a) their indices are different: output 0<br>
    
    b) their indices are the same: only one element, ouput 0 directly<br>

### Implement
> - Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants)

see solution.py

### Review
> - Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples
> - Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug
### Evaluate
> - Finish by giving space and run-time complexity

Assume N is the length of the input array `prices`.


- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
